\title{Gene expression signatures in acute lymphocytic leukemia for BCR signaling pathway}
\description{
Several distinct genetic mechanisms lead to acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) malignant transformations deriving 
from distinct lymphoid precursor cells that have been committed to either T-lineage or B-lineage differentiation.
Chromosome translocations and molecular rearrangements are common events in B-lineage ALL and reflect distinct 
mechanisms of transformation. The B cell Receptor (BCR/ABL) gene rearrangement occurs in about 25\% of cases in 
adult ALL, and much less frequently in pediatric ALL. 
\code{y2} dataset contains gene expression signatures of BCR signaling pathway (composed by 35 gene products, n.columns = 35)
in acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) cells not associated with BCR/ABL gene rearrangement (n. rows = 41).
Expression values are normalized according to \code{rma} and \code{quantile}
normalization.
