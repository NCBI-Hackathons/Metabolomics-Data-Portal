    # According to the documentation, the following comments on 'root' apply. 
    # But the modified Dockerfile changes folder permissions so it might not actually be a problem. 
    # Better to not run as root if avoidable.
    # Setting this to something other than 'root' will cause shiny apps not to
    # run on the localhost:3838 "Welcome to Shiny" diagnostics page mentioned
    # below.
